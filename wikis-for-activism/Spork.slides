== What is a Wiki?

* A bunch of web pages
* Editable from the browser
* Links between pages

----

== Wikipedia

* Edited it?

* Well-linked

== Publishing with a wiki

* Could make your public site a wiki
* Limit editing access
* Could use wiki to collaborate and publish elsewhere
* Wikipedia is a "live" publication

----

== Wikis and Email

* Email is better for conversation and decision-making
** Threaded discussion
* Wikis are good for recording decisions
** "The minutes are at http://..."
* Wikis are good for working collaboratively
** "I wrote a grant, please edit it at http://..."
* Use email to point people at wiki pages
* Much better workflow than emailing documents!

----

== Stuff in CAA's wiki

* Everything!
* Event logistics, like this conference
* Historical information (history of CAA, logos, etc)
* How-to guides (leafleting, cable access video showings, planning a potluck)
* Work in progress
** Makes review and changes easier
* Meeting minutes

----

== Stuff not in CAA's wiki

* Donor and volunteer tracking
** Wikis don't provide enough search and summary features
* Our blog
** Wikis discourage an authorial voice
* Wikis don't allow fine-grained formatting
** Not a tool for graphic design

----

== How to start your wiki?

* Start with your next event
* Resource materials
** Guides to activism
** Media - logos, letterhead
* Meeting minutes

----

== Wiki Hosting

* wikdot.org - free!
** Featureful, but not polished
* wikhost.org - also free!
** More bare-bones, less user-friendly
* pbwiki.com - free for 3 users or less
** Offers a nonprofit discount
* Many more
** http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_wiki_farms
