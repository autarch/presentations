# At the beginning of the year, I was looking for a job. You will not be surprised to hear that this was a terrible experience!

** I was looking for a job a few months back
*** The hiring process was pretty terrible!
*** Unprepared interviewers
*** Pointless questions
*** Lots of time wasting
*** Not nearly enough courtesy
*** Not nearly enough evaluation of my actual skills
*** And **slow** in many cases
*** I took a job *in spite* of the process, not because of it
** I've been on other side.
*** At my last position, grew a dev team from about 3 people to 15
*** Hired frontend & backend devs, sysadmins, and helped with other hiring
*** Worked hard to develop a better process
** What I've seen missing
*** Basic Courtesy
*** Clear Goals
*** Fairness
*** Transparency
*** Respect for my time
*** Respect for the hiring company's time

# You might be wondering why this matters. After all, we've all seemed to muddle along okay as-is.

** Wasting people's time is bad
** Losing good candidates because you're too slow
** False positives
** False negatives
** Turning off good candidates because your process sucks

# The first step in improving your process is to prepare, starting from before you post the job.

** What do you care about for the people you hire?
*** Technical skills, obviously
**** Are there specific things you want to hire for? Make sure to cover these somehow!
*** Knowledge about your domain, optionally
*** Good communication skills
**** At the very least, they need to be able to collaborate effectively with other technical staff
**** Depending on the position they may also need to be able to communicate clearly with non-technical staff too
**** Writing and organization skills, as demonstrated by their resume and cover letter
*** Do they actually want this particular job?
**** You probably want to avoid someone without any enthusiasm for this stick around
*** Anything else you think is important
*** We will come back to this again - it's important in determining your pre-screening and interviews
*** Everyone involved in hiring should agree on this rubric and commit to using it to evaluate candidates
**** Do not assume that everyone is on the same page as you. Have a meeting or two to discuss and create this rubric.
*** Culture Fit is Bullshit
**** This is a very nebulous term. If you think you're interested in culture fit, try to break this down into several narrower things you can more easily evaluate, like spoken communication skills, interest in technology (or specific technologies), work/life balance goals, etc.
** Start with Good Job Postings
*** Clear Requirements and Benefits in Posting
**** Be very careful about what is really a *required* skill
***** Good people can learn new technologies quickly
***** Flip side - sometimes you want to hire someone to *teach* your team a technology
**** I like to list more optional "nice to haves" than required skills
**** Do you really need this person to have a degree? why?
*** Clear Description of Work
**** Provide some details about the work environment, other folks on the team, the types of stuff they'll be working on
***** size of team
***** new code, old code, both
***** technologies
***** interaction with non-technical folks
*** Remote or Not
*** Include a salary range - stop jerking people around
** Quick Responses to Applications
*** Send people a thank you immediately - automated response is best
*** Send them a rejection as soon as possible - stop jerking people around
*** Move on to next steps as quickly as possible

# The next step of the process is the part that comes before interviews, including resume screening and, ideally, looking at some code.

** Keep your rubric in mind when screening resumes
** Figure out how you want to screen resumes
*** I like to have at least two people do this, eaching voting Yes, No, or Maybe. Maybe means that if the other person feels strongly they should try to convince me to change my mind.
** Technical pre-screening
*** The goal here is to figure out if people have at least some level of coding skill
*** You cannot get any sense of someone's coding skill without actually having them do real work
**** Making them do real work during an interview is cruel (more on that later)
**** There are lots of really nice people who would be great co-workers, except that they cannot code their way out of a brown paper bag
*** Homework and/or Code Samples
**** Homework should not take more than 3 hours to complete
**** Do the homework yourself - ask a few other folks on the team to do it too
**** Make sure you have a rubric for evaluating the homework
**** Write very detailed instructions for the homework
***** If someone does something different from what you expected make sure that this is covered by the instructions before you hold it against them
**** Decide on whether you want to make every applicant do the homework, or if you're okay with evaluating code samples
***** Only accept code samples that are substantial libraries or apps that were largely written by the applicant
***** The fact that they submitted PRs to a bunch of projects is a plus, but it's not the same as seeing code they created from scratch
***** But it's okay to just ask everyone to do the homework, just know that there will be some attrition because of this.

# Finally, let's talk about conducting interviews and how you can make this suck less.

** Politeness 101
*** Introductions
**** Everyone on the interview should introduce themselves, I suggest:
***** Name
***** Position in the company
***** Relationship to the potential hire ("I'd be your manager") if that's not obvious
***** How long you've been with the company
***** Where you live (for remote teams)
** Be prepared
*** Read the fucking resume and cover letter!
** Conducting Interviews
*** After introductions, tell them how the interview will be conducted.
***** Who will ask questions (one person? everyone?)
***** What types of questions you'll ask
***** What types of questions you won't ask
***** What you're looking for
***** When they can ask their own questions (you must make sure there is time for this!)
***** "Our goal is to learn more about you and for you to learn more about us and the position. We will not be asking stumper-type technical questions, nor are we looking for someone who fits a specific mold. If you have any questions during the interview please feel free to ask them as they occur to you. We’ll also make sure to leave time at the end of the interview for you to ask questions."
** Group Interviews
*** These are fine, but be very organized about it.
**** Having one person ask all the questions is okay
**** Having multiple people ask questions is okay too, just agree in advance on who asks what
**** If you're doing the interview online, have a chat channel for backchat so someone can say "I want to ask X"
** Have a Reason for All Questions
** Different Things You Can Learn in an Interview
*** Does the candidate want this particular job?
*** Is this position a good fit for this particular candidate?
***** Do their desires, needs, and expectations match up with what you can offer?
*** If it's telecommuting, can they do this effectively?
***** If they've done it before, great
***** If not, probe about their plans for telecommuting? Work space, hours, handling interruptions, etc.
*** Can the candidate communicate effectively? Are they pleasant to talk to?
*** Can they communicate effectively about technical topics?
*** Can they communicate effectively with non-technical people? (If this matters)
*** Do they care about technical stuff, but not **too much**?
*** Do they ask good questions?
** Example Questions and Why I Ask Them
*** What appeals to you about this position?
***** I want to make sure that what appeals to them is actually what we're offering and that they haven't misunderstood something about the position?
*** What are the most important things for you in a position?
**** Same goal
*** What reservations do you have about this position?
**** Same goal
*** What programming languages have you used? Which was your favorite? Why? Tell us some things you don't like about your favorite?
**** Show them you've read their resume by saying "I see you've used Perl and Python, are there any others you've used?"
**** I want to know if they have technical opinions. Are they thoughtful about the tools they use?
*** What is one of the hardest technical problems you've solved?
*** Tell us about one of the dirtiest hacks you’ve ever implemented. How would you go back and fix it?
*** Describe what you think an ideal development workflow would look like.
** Unfolding Technical Questions
*** Let's sketch out a design for X. Pick something relevant to the job. It could be a REST API, an application front end, a batch processing tool, whatever.
**** Be prepared to answer *their* questions about the system
*** Once they have a good initial answer, gradually make it more complicated:
**** What if the system has to operate across multiple data centers?
**** How do you handle updates from multiple users at once?
**** What happens if the batch system dies 6 hours into a 12 hour process?
**** How would you instrument the system to better analyze problems?
**** How would you test the system?
**** What if you have to accomodate a 10x increase in traffic, users, data?
** Puzzles Are Bullshit
*** Every question you ask should have a purpose. Brain teasers do not relate very closely to the work they will be doing, so what could you possibly learn from this?
** Very specific technical questions are bullshit
*** If it can be quickly looked up online, do not ask about it. Someone's ability to memorize specific algorithms, data structures, or APIs does not correlate very closely to their ability to do the work.
** Coding in Interviews
** Whiteboard Coding is Bullshit
*** Lots has been written on this.
*** It's a totally unrealistic environment.
*** You're not actually testing them on anything like real work.
*** It's very stressful and cruel
*** Note that sketching out a system architecture or something on a whiteboard is fine. That's what whiteboards are for, and that's like doing real work!
** Live Coding is Mostly Bullshit
*** Hey, at least it's not on a whiteboard
*** But it's still very stressful and cruel
*** There is one exception
** Pairing
*** At my last position, we introduced another step after the homework and technical interview. We'd have one dev pair with the candidate to do something with their homework. This could be fixing bugs, writing tests, or adding new features.
**** This should be much less stressful since it's their own code, and the problem is not new to them.
**** It's a great way of finding out how you would work with the candidate, since you're actually working with the candidate.
** Multiple Interviews
** Why Bother?
*** Fewer interviews is better
**** quicker
**** less stressful for the candidate
*** But if there's a person with less free time (like the CEO or CTO) who really wants to interview promising candidates, you may need to do this
** Who Should Ask What?
*** Coordinate closely with all interviews to avoid too much redundancy between interviews
** Tying it to Rubric
*** Make sure each interview is operating off your shared rubric
